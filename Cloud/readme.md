# Cloud Code Demo

You should generate your own Cloud Code on the command line -- it's easy. Install the tool here: https://parse.com/docs/cloud_code_guide#started

Generate a new project with `parse new appName` -- then enter your Parse credentials, select the app you want to create Cloud Code for, and everything gets generated for you. Then feel free to copy/use the code in this directory's `main.js` file.
